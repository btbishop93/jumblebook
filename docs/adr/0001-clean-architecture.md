# ADR 0001: Adoption of Clean Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The application needs a scalable and maintainable architecture that:
- Allows for easy testing
- Supports multiple data sources (Firebase, local storage)
- Maintains separation of concerns
- Makes the codebase easier to understand and modify
- Facilitates future feature additions

We considered several architectural patterns:
1. Simple BLoC Pattern
2. MVVM
3. Clean Architecture

## Decision
We will implement Clean Architecture with three main layers:
- Domain (business logic)
- Data (external interfaces)
- Presentation (UI and state management)

### Key Implementation Details
1. **Domain Layer**
```dart
lib/features/auth/domain/
├── entities/          // Pure business objects
│   └── user.dart
├── repositories/      // Abstract interfaces
│   └── auth_repository.dart
└── usecases/         // Business logic
    └── sign_in_user.dart
```

2. **Data Layer**
```dart
lib/features/auth/data/
├── repositories/      // Concrete implementations
└── datasources/      // External services
```

3. **Presentation Layer**
```dart
lib/features/auth/presentation/
├── bloc/             // State management
├── pages/           // Screens
└── widgets/         // UI components
```

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear separation of concerns
- Highly testable code
- Independence from external frameworks
- Easy to add new features
- Clear dependency rules

### Negative
- More initial boilerplate code
- Steeper learning curve for new developers
- Overhead for very simple features
- Need for strict code review to maintain architecture

### Mitigations
1. Create templates for common patterns
2. Document architecture decisions clearly
3. Use linting rules to enforce boundaries
4. Regular architecture reviews

## Alternatives Considered

### Simple BLoC
- Pros: Less boilerplate, faster development
- Cons: Less rigid boundaries, harder to scale

### MVVM
- Pros: Good UI/business separation, familiar pattern
- Cons: Less clear data flow, potential ViewModel bloat
